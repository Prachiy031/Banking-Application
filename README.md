### Hi there 👋, I am Prachi
#### This is Banking Application created for learning purpose. 
#### This includes core banking microservices like User Service for handling users' profiles, Account Service for handling users' banking accounts, 
#### Fund Transfer Service for handling fund transfers, Transaction Service for handling transactions during fund transfer, 
#### Sequence Generator service for creating sequential account number. 

All microservices are registered to eureka service registry as a eureka clients with unique dedicated ports. 
Microservices are routed to correct required services using API gateway which is used for routing, load balancing, rate limiting, etc. 

Keycloak is used as oauth2 server for authenticating user and securing application. 
This project has used Mapstruct for mapping entity objects to DTOs and vice versa 
as Mapstruct provides actual Java implementation during compilation phase using 
methods in interfaces defined for mapping. MySQL relational database is used for 
this project for creating databases.

I have used postman for testing  endpoints defined in controller.

In future I am focusing on: Docker, Kubernetes to implement for this project.

Skills: Java, Spring Boot, Maven, Spring cloud, Postman, Keycloak UI, MySQL, SQL
